# ExpressServerMongoose-Template

## Description 
This template is the basis to develop a complete Express Server API that uses a MongoDB as database. 

## Installation 
* You must have installed [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
* Download the repository
* Open a terminal and locate it at the repository path location 
* Run the command <code>npm install</code>

## Notes
* I recommend to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) environment to try out the HTTP requests to the server.
